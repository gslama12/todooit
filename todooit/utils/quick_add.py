"""
A whole task read out of one typed line, in the style of Todoist's quick add

The line is written the way the task would be said -- "call the dentist #Home
@phone p1 e1 tomorrow 09:00" -- and the markers below pick the fields out of
it: which project it is filed under, what it is tagged with, how urgent it is,
how big a job it is, and the day it is planned for. Everything none of them
claims is the description, so the sentence survives having been read.

A todo carries two dates, and a line saying one date means the day the work is
planned for: that is the one there is a day-to-day answer to, and the one the
Today and Upcoming panes are built on. The deadline is the other question, and
is asked by name -- `due=friday`, `due=3w` -- since a line rarely has cause to
say both.

Only the reading is done here. What the names mean -- which project `#Home`
is, whether there is one -- is the app's business, and is settled where the
database is.
