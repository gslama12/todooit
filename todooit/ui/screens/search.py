"""
The finder: every task in the database, narrowed down as it is typed

The old search filtered the pane that happened to be in front -- it could only
find what was already on screen, and finding it left the pane greyed out until
escape was pressed. What a search is actually for here is the other thing: a
task is somewhere in the tree, and the point is to get to it.

So this looks through every task there is, whichever project it is filed under
and whether or not it is still to be done, and what it hands back is the one
that was picked. Where the app then goes is `MainScreen.reveal_todo`'s
business.
