The command line: a whole task typed in one line, over the top of the app

Every other way of adding a task in dooit is a row and a column at a time --
open the project, add the todo, name it, then type a date into the column
beside it. This is the same task said in one breath, from wherever you happen
to be standing, and it never moves the cursor off what you were looking at.

The line is read by `dooit.utils.quick_add`; what is left here is the panel it
is typed into, what the panel says about the line as it is being typed, and
the one place the task is actually written to the database.
