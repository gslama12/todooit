    A row here is a whole task: one finished todo, with the steps that were

    them. Nothing arrives on its own until the whole of it is done.

    Unticking a todo anywhere else takes it out of the pane it was in and puts
    it back among the work still to do. Doing that here would drop the row out
    of the only pane it is in, mid-thought, before anything could be said
    about when the task is supposed to happen now.

    So the task is held instead: it stays where it was sitting, unticked and
    edited like a row in any other pane, and is let go of once that edit has
    been confirmed — or once the cursor has walked away without one. Held
    whole, whichever of its rows was unticked, since unticking any step of a
    task sends the task itself back: what is held is never half a family.
