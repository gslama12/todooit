    The scratchpad: a note that belongs to nothing in particular

    It is kept in the database beside the todos rather than in a file of its
    own, so that it travels with them: what is jotted down before it is a task
    is as much the user's work as the tasks are, and a note left behind by a
    copied database would go missing exactly when it mattered.

    The table is created by `metadata.create_all` on the way in like every
    other one, so a database that predates the note grows it on first launch
    with nothing to migrate - there is no old column to carry over.
