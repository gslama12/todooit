"""
Throwing work away, and getting it back

Nothing in dooit is deleted by accident. A todo that is dropped goes to the
Bin, where it stays, whole, until it is either restored or deleted for good;
the only things that actually remove a row are the keys that ask first — the
one that deletes what the cursor is on, and the one that empties the Bin out.

Dropping a project is the same thing one level up: everything filed under it
goes to the Bin carrying the path it came from, and the project row itself is
the only part that goes. That path is what a todo is put back into when it is
revived — the project is built again out of its own name if nobody kept it, so
restoring something never quietly drops it somewhere else.
